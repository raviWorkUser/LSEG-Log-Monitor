# LogMonitor

LogMonitor is a Java application that reads a log file with job start and end times,
calculates job durations, and generates a report showing if jobs finished on time,
took too long, or are incomplete.

## How to Use

1. Put your log file (e.g., `logs.log`) in the project directory.
2. Run the application.
3. The report will be saved as `<log_file_name>_output.log` in the same directory.

## Log File Format

Each line should look like this:

11:35:56,scheduled task 032, END,37980
